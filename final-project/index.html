            <p>I am a garden designer and coach and provide my services on an hourly basis. My rate is $50 per hour.
                During the initial consultation we would discuss what your project goals, scope, timeline and budget
                are. I also like to understand what your specific design aesthetic is, any specific problems you're
                trying to solve, and possible approaches. I'll share some initial thoughts on approach and we can decide
                on next steps. <br><br>I spent over 25 years in the tech industry, but after retiring from Microsoft in
                2013 I went back to school for my real passion and earned a degree in Environmental Horticulture. A
                friend and I started Dig In in 2017. I have a strong belief in sustainable gardening and in preserving
                our limited resources. I encourage the use of native plants, where it makes reasonable sense, but also
                love taking advantage of the diversity of plants that thrive in our mild climate. My recommendations
                will come with that as a basis. My desire is to work with people who appreciate their gardens and want
                to know more about them. The role I prefer is Garden Coach, which is focused on teaching my clients and
                working with in their garden directly. Although I work to be flexible and provide the level of service
                that best meets your needs and interests.</p>
