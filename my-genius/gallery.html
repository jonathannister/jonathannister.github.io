            between the weapons
            used in foil,
            epee, and saber, and more!</h2><br>

        <p class="galleryp">This is a foil practice blade. Typically, there is a wire running through the blade to
            be
            able to detect when the point is depressed. This handle is called a pistol grip.</p>

        <p class="galleryp">This is an epee blade. As you can see, the pommel is much larger and rounder, and the
            blade
            is also thicker.</p>
        <img src="images/epeeblade.jpg" alt=" Epee Blade" class="imgcenter"><br><br><br>
        <p class="galleryp">This is a saber blade. Here you can see where the body cord (wire) would be plugged in.
            This
            pommel also comes around to cover the bottom of your hand.</p>

        <p class="galleryp">This is a chart of the parries in fencing, parry 1 through parry 9. Each one is used to
            cover a different part of the target, but parries 4, 6, 7, and 8 are most common. </p>

        <p class="galleryp">Recently, I had the chance to meet foil Olympian Alexander Massialas at my local club,
            RCFC.
            In this photo, I'm wearing his medal from Rio.</p>
