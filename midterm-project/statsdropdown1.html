<!--How I challenged myself:

    One of the ways I challenged myself through this project was doing the actual research 
    and making content to help our community. By looking at the statistics pages you should 
    learn a few new things. More so, the little details added to make my webpage look better 
    (ex. the question prompt function with javascript or the smooth scroll to the top function with css)
    was challenging you have to learn how you will implement it in your own webpage. Normally, we have 
    done assignments and demos with certain requirements which made it easier to complete. However, as
    this assignment was mostly free (besides the minimal requirements) there were so many options in terms
    of topics, grid layout, and color themes etc., that made this project even more challenging, especially
    for me. At the start of our CSS Demo, coming up with good designs with good color choices has been a bit
    challenging. However, through this assignment, I proposed our final topic (homelessness), modified our
    color theme to fit better, and proposed a group grid layout for our external css. I improved on many things
    like making useful content for a webpage, and using good color themes as well as being efficient with HTML, CSS, 
    and Javascript by using techniques taught in class and learning new features outside of class for projects like these.
