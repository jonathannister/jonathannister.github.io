<!-- 

I challenged myself in this project by trying to help coordinate this project with all of our group memebers and making sure that everybody had their say in this project. I did this by pulling up a whiteboard to figure out what we would do for not only our color scheme but also our grid layout design. I also mentioned after every class period what we should all get done by the start of the next class or what we needed to get done or how to coordinate to things done (I made our group chat). A way that I made sure everyone had their say was by asking how people would like the grid layout to be. Specifically, I remember Anish asking about a side nav bar and I included his suggestion by integrating it with our current design format but just making it up to each group member how they wanted to size the grids. In conclusion, I think that I challenged myself in this project not through the coding or content but through better teamwork.

                <h2>What Seattle is doing...</h4>
                    <p>Seattle's policy framework for addressing homelessness:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Person-centered service model</li>
                        <li>Invest in programs that effectively connect people to housing</li>
                        <li>Address racial disparities</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Seattle has changed how they are investing in homelessness services. First, they are increasing
                        access to Housing & Diversion. There has been a 10% increase in rent paid without subsidy and
                        19% increase in people moving into permanent housing after using diversion funds. Second,
                        they're shifting to a Person-Centered Service Model. Seattle has opened 2 new shelters with 175
                        enhanced shelter beds, enhanced 67% of the 1773 shelter beds, and enhanced 25 shelters. All the
                        shelters have extended hours and supportive services. Third, they are improving government
                        accountability by better training for staff, active contract management, better funding and
                        governance agreements, and competitive funding proccesses for service contracts.
