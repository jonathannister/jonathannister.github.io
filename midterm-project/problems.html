<!-- I challenged myself in this project by spend a lot of time carefully producing webpages that wouldn't have bugs or issues.
A challenge was having a consistent theme and structure amongst my two pages. Fixing issues on HTML and JS was a challenge enough for me, and
I succeeded in this. I also feel that I coordinated with my groupmembers well, which I have struggled to do in the past.  -->

                <h3>Who is Homeless?</h3>
                <p>Homelessness is a broad term, and there are different levels of homelessness, whether it be living in
                    a homeless shelter or
                    living in a tent by the highway. Because of this, it's difficult for officials to determine who is
                    homeless, and how they
                    must solve the homeless crisis in seattle
                <h3>Why Efforts From Officials Have Not Worked</h3>
                <p>Homelessness has been categorized as an issue that is deeper than just not being able to afford a
                    home.
                    It is caused by deeper systemic issues like racism and access to education. There is a correlation
                    between who has access to schooling and connection to culture and society. Homelessness will remain
                    an issue until those who have experienced homelessness have a say in what the solution (if there is
                    a
                    viable one) is.
